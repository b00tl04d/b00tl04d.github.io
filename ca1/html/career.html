They will be trained to deal with advanced cyber threats, engage in real-world cybersecurity operations and contribute to the national cyber ecosystem. All National Service (NS ) pre-enlistees are eligible to apply. Applicants are expected to possess baseline knowledge and skills in cybersecurity.</p>

                <p class="cyber-nsf-paragraph">Cyber Operators will perform basic roles such as threat monitoring and assessment. Selected NSFs who possess the skills and aptitude may be offered the Cyber Specialist Award, allowing them to serve as Cyber Specialists in specialised roles and receive various developmental opportunities to continue upgrading their skills over a period of 3 or 4 years.</p>
