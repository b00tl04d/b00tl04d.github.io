                <p class="about-me-paragraph">After graduating from Fairfield Methodist School (Secondary) in 2019, I enrolled in Nitec Infocomm Technology course at ITE College West. During this time I started to take keen interest in cybersecurity knowledge.</p>

                <p class="about-me-paragraph">During the 2 years in Nitec, I learned C# programming, webpage design, and networking. During my free time I learn various programming languages such as Python, C++, Rust, Golang, and Java. I am also active on platforms such as TryHackMe and HackTheBox to further my cybersecurity expertise.

            <p>I also plan to complete a degree in Computer Science to broaden my IT knowledge, in areas such as AI, Software Development, IT Infrastructure and Cloud Computing. These areas complement the cybersecurity field.</p>

            <p>With a Computer Science degree, I plan for a career in penetrating testing. I enjoy the challenges from HackTheBox and TryHackMe as they stimulate me to think of solutions for problem solving. Penetration testing requires such problem-solving skills.</p>
